# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
I want to make something that looks somewhat like a flower, but complex modern and cool.

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
I could have a variable that affects the whole code to wither increase or decrease the level of complexity.

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
I want to use ranges and for loops to make the flower look semetrical, and allow one variable to affect all of them.

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
It will be one large complex flower, with many lines, and posibly colors.

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

I think it will include many shapes, but esspecialy triangles and parollelagrams, or maybe like a reocurring heptagon.
